<h1>Heart Disease Prediction Project</h1>

<p>Recently, the rate of heart diseases has increased and it’s becoming more common among people. This leads to many serious issues in people's lives, often resulting in death. In our project, we aim to study and analyze patient data to identify possible factors and risks associated with heart diseases. This analysis will help many people take precautions by predicting the likelihood of developing heart disease.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>Our project utilizes two data mining tasks—classification and clustering—to assist in predicting the likelihood of heart disease:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Classification:</strong> We will train our model to classify whether a patient has heart disease or not, based on a set of medical examinations.</li>
  <li><strong>Clustering:</strong> Our model will create clusters of patients with similar characteristics, which can then be used to predict outcomes for new patients.</li>
</ul>

<p>The target class, or class label, will divide patients into two groups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Patients at risk of heart disease, labeled as <strong>1</strong></li>
  <li>Patients without symptoms, labeled as <strong>0</strong></li>
</ul>
