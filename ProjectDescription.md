Recently, Heart diseases rate has been increased and it’s becoming more common among people, which leads to many serious problems in people's lives that can be led to death. 
In our project, we will study and analyze patients’ data that will help us well in identifying possible factors and risks that lead to heart diseases and help many people to take
precautions by predicting the possibility of having a heart disease.  

In our project we will use two data mining tasks to help us predict the possibility of having heart diseases which are classification and clustering.
For classification we will train our model to be able to classify if the patient has heart diseases or not based on a set of medical examinations.
For the clustering our model will create a set of clusters for the patient who has similar characteristics, then these clusters will be used to predict new patients’ results.
