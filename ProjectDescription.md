In our project we will use two data mining tasks to help us predict the possibility of having heart diseases which are classification and clustering.
For classification we will train our model to be able to classify if the patient has heart diseases or not based on a set of medical examinations.
For the clustering our model will create a set of clusters for the patient who has similar characteristics, then these clusters will be used to predict new patientsâ€™ results.
